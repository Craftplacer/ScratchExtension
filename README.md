# Craftplacer's ScratchX Extension
The title literally says what it is.

## Categories and Blocks

### ![variableOperation](/scratchblocks/variableOperation.png?raw=true)

Internally called `variableOperation`, this block might look confusing at first but you know programming enough you might recognize it as block that increments the variable.
This makes it easier since you don't have to use `[set [variable] to (variable + (1))]`. In the third field you can choose from `++` (increment) and `--` (decrement). The fourth field is what the value is to do the operation (default: 1).
